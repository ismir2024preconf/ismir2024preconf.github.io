The impact of quantum computing on the music industry is inevitable. The emerging field of Quantum Computer Music investigates and develops applications and methods to process music using quantum computing technology. This talk will discuss examples of approaches to leverage quantum computing to learn, process and generate music. The methods discussed range from rendering music using data from physical quantum mechanical systems and quantum mechanical simulations to computational quantum algorithms to generate music, including quantum AI. The ambition to develop techniques to encode audio quantumly for making sound synthesisers and audio signal processing systems is also discussed.","Eduardo Reck Miranda is a classically trained composer and computer scientist. He has composed for renowned ensembles such as the BBC Concert Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra and London Sinfonietta. He is a Professor of Computer Music at the University of Plymouth, UK, and works with Moth, a quantum technology company building the next era of music, gaming and the arts. Prof Miranda published over 100 research papers in learned journals and 16 books. He is world-renowned for his groundbreaking work in AI and music. He is a pioneer of quantum computing with a focus on creativity and music composition. His latest book, Quantum Computer Music, comprising a collection of chapters by leading practitioners in the field, was published in 2022 by Springer Nature.",1

I will first focus on the paradigm shift from knowledge-driven to data-driven algorithmic design, thanks to recent developments in machine learning.  After that, I will discuss the current challenges that the MIR field addresses and the current and future research challenges, notably on the social and ethical impact of MIR algorithmic systems.","Dr. Emilia Gómez (MSc. Telecommunication Engineering, PhD in Computer Science, Full professor accreditation) is a senior scientist at the European Commission\’s Joint Research Centre, where she leads the Human Behaviour and Machine Intelligence (HUMAINT) team that provides scientific support to EU AI policies as part of the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency, notably the AI Act and the Digital Services Act. She is also a guest professor in Music Technology at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain.\n Dr Gómez has a long academic experience in the field of Music Information Retrieval, where she has contributed to different approaches for music content description, notably in pitch-content description. Starting from the music domain, she now studies the impact of AI in human behaviour, notably how AI affects jobs, decisions, fundamental rights and children. She was the first female president of ISMIR, is currently a member of the OECD One AI expert group, an ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent systems) fellow, and her work has been recognized by means of citations and honors, e.g. EUWomen4Future, Red Cross Award to Humanitarian Technologies or ICREA Academia."",1
